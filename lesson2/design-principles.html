                    Fitts' law states that the amount of time required to move the mouse cursor 
                    to a target area is proportional to the distance to the target divided by the 
                    size of the target. This means that the longer the distance and the smaller the 
                    target's size, the longer it takes. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints'
                    website is a good example of this. The website uses very large buttons for featured 
                    articles and the distance between them is very short. Making it easier and faster to 
                    browse through the website.

                    Hick's Law examines the relationship between the number of stimuli present
                    and the individual's reaction time to any given stimulus. This means that 
                    if you reduce the number of stimuli you'll get a faster decision-making process.
                    The IBM website is a good example of this. While IBM offers a lot of option, 
                    they applied the "K.I.S.S" principle on their menu in order to keep things short and 
                    simple. When entering into each sub-menu, many more options are presented. Sometimes,
                    there is no avoiding complexity, and the IBM website shows that while still combining it
                    with Hick's Law.

                    Visual Hierarchy refers to the arrangament and presentation of elements in a way
                    that denotes importance while influencing the order in which it is perceived by 
                    end user. In web design, the F-Pattern explains the way our eyes scan a website. 
                    Studies have shown that we read in an F shaped pattern while browsing the internet.
                    With a well-executed design, the most important information is placed within an F pattern
                    allowing the user to quickly find the information they need. The Squarespace website is a
                    good example of this. You can easily scan the images and catch keywords with ease.
